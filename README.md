# React Employee Search Application

This project is a **React-based application** that allows users to dynamically search and filter employee data based on input queries. It features a responsive table displaying employee details such as names, roles, and email addresses.

## Features
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for employees using names, roles, or email addresses. The table updates dynamically in real-time to display matching results.
- **Responsive Table:** Clean and organized table layout for easy viewing of employee data.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Data is filtered using JavaScript's `Array.filter()` and `String.includes()` methods for efficient functionality.
- **Customizable Design:** Modular structure allows easy customization and scalability.

## How It Works
1. Users enter their query in the search input field.
2. The application filters employee data from the `users` array based on the query.
3. Matching results are displayed in a table format.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For creating the UI and handling state management.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** For dynamic functionalities like filtering and real-time updates.
